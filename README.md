# CollegePlace

**This is the codebase for the ongoing project**

This is a project I am currently part of. We are trying to build a new facility for our college to help the students at their college ventures.

It might not be possible to upload the codes to this repository (both for security reasons and also nobody likes to read shitty code), but I shall try to keep this readme updated as a measure to link down anyone interested to see the live project in action.

Thanks for making your way to the end of this document (whew!), but if you need to contact me for any reason (cannot think of any), mail me at krishna.bose02@gmail.com
