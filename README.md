### After clicking the pink button you get this

### And here for selecting sem/uncategorized

### This page dynamically fetches all the subject titles for the current dept/sem combo

   Wait! I'm creating more...
   And btw, the sem and dept pages use dynamic resizing of the tabs (similar of responsive design for web) So, none of it will ever go outside view. (Subject page was intentionally kept scrollable and not responsive)
